## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of UX design, staying informed is both a challenge and a necessity. My tailored watch system combines **Inoreader** for content aggregation, **Notion** for organization, and a robust approach for long-term storage. Additionally, I actively follow **thought leaders in UX** to stay connected to industry insights.

## Capturing Information with Inoreader

Inoreader is my go-to tool for collecting and monitoring a variety of UX-focused sources.

### How I Use It:
- **RSS Feeds**:
  - Blogs: NNGroup, Smashing Magazine, UX Collective.
  - Newsletters: Prototypr Weekly.
- **Categories**:
  - Feeds grouped into themes like `#UXResearch`, `#Prototyping`, and `#Accessibility`.

### Why It Works:
Inoreader allows me to scan and mark relevant articles, centralizing my information flow for daily or weekly reviews.

---

## Tracking Key Personalities in UX

Beyond blogs, I follow UX influencers to access raw ideas and cutting-edge insights.

### Approach:
1. **Platforms**:
   - **Twitter/X** and **LinkedIn** to follow experts like Don Norman, Jared Spool, and Vitaly Friedman.
2. **Integration**:
   - Social feeds or blogs from these personalities are added to **Inoreader** or saved manually to **Notion**.
3. **Engagement**:
   - I save impactful threads or posts for later review and tagging in **Notion**.

### Why It‚Äôs Valuable:
Thought leaders often share trends, methodologies, and real-world examples that enhance my understanding of UX challenges and solutions.

## Organizing and Reviewing with Notion

Notion acts as the second layer in my watch system, providing structure and enabling in-depth reviews.

### Database Setup:
- **Columns**:
  - **Title**, **Source**, **Link**, **Tags**, **Status**, and **Summary**.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Articles and posts from Inoreader are saved into Notion.
  2. Weekly reviews add summaries and tags like `#UXTesting` or `#DesignSystems`.
  3. Important entries are flagged for project use or long-term storage.

---

## Long-Term Storage and Backup Strategy

While my system relies on Notion for organization, I take specific steps to ensure the security and accessibility of my data.

### Current Approach:
1. **Storing PDFs in Notion**:
   - I use **SingleFile** (a browser extension) to save important articles as cleanly formatted PDFs.
   - These PDFs are uploaded directly to their corresponding entries in my Notion database.

2. **Backing Up Notion**:
   - I perform regular exports of my Notion workspace in **Markdown + Fichiers** format.
   - These backups are stored locally on my machine and synchronized with a cloud service (e.g., Google Drive).

3. **Future-Proofing the System**:
   - Since all PDFs and Markdown files are saved locally, I have full control over my data.
   - If I ever decide to migrate from Notion, my data is already structured and ready for integration into other tools like **Obsidian**, **Logseq**, or even a simple local folder system.

### Why This Matters:
This approach ensures I never lose access to valuable resources, regardless of Notion‚Äôs future availability or changes to my workflow.

---

## A Typical Workflow

Here‚Äôs how I use my watch system on a daily and weekly basis:

### Daily:
1. Open **Inoreader** and scan for new articles in my RSS feeds.
2. Check social media feeds for posts from key personalities.
3. Mark interesting articles or posts as "To Read" or save them directly to Notion.
4. Optionally, skim through short articles or threads immediately.

### Weekly:
1. Go through my Notion database and review the "To Read" entries.
2. Add summaries and tags to important articles or insights.
3. Save the most critical ones in PDF format using SingleFile.

## Benefits of My Watch System

1. **Efficiency**:
   - Centralizes all my sources (blogs, social media, thought leaders) into one system.
   - Keeps my reading and review process simple and organized.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Notion allows me to adapt the system to changing needs or focus areas.
   - Easy integration with other tools like Zapier for future automation.

3. **Future-Proofing**:
   - With local backups and PDFs saved in Notion, my data is secure and accessible for the long term.

## Conclusion

My watch system not only keeps me informed about UX design trends but also ensures the longevity and security of my curated knowledge. By combining Inoreader, Notion, and thoughtful backup practices, I‚Äôve built a system that supports both my daily needs and long-term goals.
