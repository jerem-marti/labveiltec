## Introduction

Managing digital overload is a common challenge in modern professional environments. Email, in particular, often overwhelms users with constant notifications and cluttered interfaces. **Maili**, a tangible user interface (TUI), redefines email management by materializing data and integrating tactile feedback into workflows. 

This article delves into the detailed UX research conducted during the design and evaluation of Maili, highlighting its impact on productivity, engagement, and stress reduction.

## Maili's UX Research Framework

The UX research methodology for Maili was structured into three key stages:

1. **Exploration**: Identifying user pain points and needs.
2. **Prototype Development and Usability Testing**: Iterative design informed by user feedback.
3. **Field Study**: Evaluating Maili in real-world settings over one month.

---

## Phase 1: Exploration

### User Interviews
Interviews with 10 professionals across various industries revealed key pain points in email management:
- **Difficulty Prioritizing Tasks**: Many users struggled to identify and focus on critical emails.
- **Notification Overload**: Constant interruptions reduced productivity and increased stress.
- **Inefficient Tools**: Traditional interfaces often felt disconnected from the users' mental models of organization.

### Task Analysis
Observation of participants' email workflows highlighted the following behaviors:
- Heavy reliance on visual markers (e.g., marking emails as unread).
- Frequent procrastination when managing complex or ambiguous tasks.
- Overuse of email folders, leading to cluttered and hard-to-navigate systems.

### Key Findings
The exploratory phase established the foundation for Maili's design:
1. **Tactile Interaction**: Users needed more engaging, physical ways to interact with tasks.
2. **Clear Notifications**: Immediate, visual, and tactile indicators were preferred over traditional alerts.

## Phase 2: Prototype Development and Usability Testing

### Iterative Prototyping
Based on the insights gathered, the team developed multiple iterations of Maili, testing different layouts, node mechanics, and tray designs.

### Usability Testing
Prototypes were evaluated with small groups of users to refine:
- **Node Responsiveness**: Ensuring smooth and satisfying tactile feedback.
- **Dial Functionality**: Testing scrolling speed and reconfirmation settings.
- **Tray Layout**: Optimizing spatial organization for email categories.

### Key Adjustments
- Adjusted node size to balance tactility with space efficiency.
- Refined dial sensitivity to align with natural scrolling behaviors.
- Added visual cues to the tray for better task differentiation.

## Phase 3: Field Study

### Study Design
The final version of Maili was deployed with five participants over a one-month period. Participants used Maili as their primary tool for email management in their daily workflows.

#### Objectives
1. Assess Maili's usability and integration into existing workflows.
2. Measure its impact on task completion and productivity.
3. Understand emotional and cognitive responses to tangible interaction.

### Research Methods
1. **Diary Studies**  
   Participants recorded daily interactions with Maili, noting:
   - Number of tasks completed.
   - Emotional responses to tactile notifications.
   - Perceived ease of use.

2. **Behavioral Observation**  
   Researchers observed participants in their natural work environments, focusing on:
   - How often Maili was used.
   - The efficiency of task prioritization and completion.

3. **Post-Study Interviews**  
   Participants provided in-depth feedback on their experiences, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement.

## UX Research Findings

### Usability and Productivity
- **Task Completion**: Participants completed 25% more email-related tasks compared to their previous workflows.
- **Efficiency**: Physical nodes reduced the time spent searching for important emails.

### Engagement and Emotional Impact
- **Engagement**: The tactile nature of interactions made users feel more connected to their tasks. One participant described Maili as "a refreshing change from traditional apps."
- **Reduced Stress**: Participants reported lower levels of email-related anxiety due to the clear, tactile notifications.

### Challenges Identified
- **Learning Curve**: Some users required time to adapt to the tangible interaction model.
- **Hardware Limitations**: Occasional mechanical issues with nodes highlighted the need for durability improvements.

## Implications for UX Design

The success of Maili underscores the potential of tangible interfaces in addressing common digital challenges. Key takeaways for UX designers include:

1. **Integrating Multi-Sensory Feedback**
   - Tactile and visual cues enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

2. **Simplifying Complex Workflows**
   - Materializing tasks into physical interactions reduces cognitive overload.

3. **Bridging Analog and Digital**
   - Hybrid designs that combine physical and digital elements can create more intuitive experiences.

---

## Conclusion

Maili demonstrates how tangible interaction can transform email management, making it more intuitive, engaging, and productive. Its success lies in its ability to bridge the gap between digital functionality and physical interaction, offering a fresh approach to tackling digital overload.

As digital environments continue to evolve, tangible interfaces like Maili offer a blueprint for creating tools that not only simplify workflows but also enrich user experiences.
