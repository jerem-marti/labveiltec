## Who I Am

I'm **Jérémy Martin**, a Swiss-based front-end developer and UX designer with a passion for crafting meaningful, user-centered digital experiences. My expertise in **Vue.js**, **Nuxt**, and **UX design** allows me to bridge the gap between design and technology, creating solutions that are both functional and visually engaging.

With a foundation in media engineering, I approach each project with a strategic, user-first mindset, aiming to deliver high-quality results that make a positive impact. Outside of work, I’m dedicated to community projects, sustainability, and exploring innovative ways to make technology more accessible and impactful.

For more details on my background, please check out my [CV](/docs/CV-2025-V2.pdf) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-martin).

## Ikigai

My Ikigai is rooted in creating impactful user experiences through **UX Design and Front-End Development**. I aim to design and build digital solutions that are functional, aesthetically pleasing, and socially relevant. This approach bridges my passion for technology with the goal of meaningful contributions in a business context.

## How I Built This Site

I chose **Nuxt** as the framework for this blog because I'm eager to deepen my knowledge of Nuxt, which builds upon **Vue.js**, a technology we've covered in our courses. I found it a natural progression, offering powerful capabilities for modern web development.

### Steps I Took

1. **Nuxt Content**  
   I discovered the **Nuxt Content** module, which allows for content creation using markdown files. This module is particularly useful for static sites, as it simplifies content management and provides flexibility for future expansions.

2. **Template Selection**  
   I explored three templates, but the first two encountered errors with the `generate` command, which pre-renders each route of the application to create static HTML files suitable for static hosting environments.

3. **Final Template**  
   I ultimately chose a simple template from [Nuxt's template site](https://nuxt.com/templates), specifically the [Content Wind template](https://github.com/atinux/content-wind) by Atinux.

4. **Custom Configuration**  
   To ensure smooth deployment on GitHub Pages, I made several configurations:
   - Added a `.nojekyll` file, addressing a [Nuxt issue](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/10344).
   - Configured the path via the `nuxt.config` file, following guidelines from [this resource](https://github.com/darioTecchia/nuxt3-ghpages/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).
   - Integrated the [gh-pages package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to publish the site to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub, which simplifies deployment.

With these steps, I now have a lightweight, responsive site that’s easy to manage and aligned with my goals to learn and grow in front-end development and content creation.
