I'm passionate about combining creativity with technical skills to develop solutions that are both functional and impactful. My expertise in UX and front-end development, supported by an entrepreneurial mindset, allows me to bring ideas to life in ways that resonate with users and drive innovation. This journey has been shaped by a strong focus on user-centered design, collaboration, and continuous learning.

## Ikigai

My Ikigai is rooted in creating impactful user experiences through **UX Design and Front-End Development**. I aim to design and build digital solutions that are functional, aesthetically pleasing, and socially relevant. This approach bridges my passion for technology with the goal of meaningful contributions in a business context.

## How I Built This Site

I chose **Nuxt** as the framework for this blog because I'm eager to deepen my knowledge of Nuxt, which builds upon **Vue.js**, a technology we've covered in our courses. I found it a natural progression, offering powerful capabilities for modern web development.

### Steps I Took

1. **Nuxt Content**  
   I discovered the **Nuxt Content** module, which allows for content creation using markdown files. This module is particularly useful for static sites, as it simplifies content management and provides flexibility for future expansions.

2. **Template Selection**  
   I explored three templates, but the first two encountered errors with the `generate` command, which pre-renders each route of the application to create static HTML files suitable for static hosting environments.

3. **Final Template**  
   I ultimately chose a simple template from [Nuxt's template site](https://nuxt.com/templates), specifically the [Content Wind template](https://github.com/atinux/content-wind) by Atinux.

4. **Custom Configuration**  
   To ensure smooth deployment on GitHub Pages, I made several configurations:
   - Added a `.nojekyll` file, addressing a [Nuxt issue](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/10344).
   - Configured the path via the `nuxt.config` file, following guidelines from [this resource](https://github.com/darioTecchia/nuxt3-ghpages/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).
   - Integrated the [gh-pages package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to publish the site to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub, which simplifies deployment.

With these steps, I now have a lightweight, responsive site that’s easy to manage and aligned with my goals to learn and grow in front-end development and content creation.
